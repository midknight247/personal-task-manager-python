# Personal Task Manager (Python CLI)

A simple command-line task manager built using Python. It supports adding, viewing, deleting, marking tasks as done, and filtering by category. Tasks are stored in a JSON file for persistence.

About thi project:
This is my first intermediate Python project, part of my journey to become an AI engineer. I built it to strengthen my grasp on Python essentials before diving into algorithms and machine learning.


## Features
- Add tasks with category and timestamp
- View all tasks or filter by category
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- Logs actions using a decorator

## Technologies Used
- Python (OOP, File I/O, JSON)
- Decorators for logging
- Command-Line Interface

## How to Run
Save the code into two files:
- `taskmanager.py` (contains the TaskManager class and logic)
- `run.py` (interface to use the manager)

Then run:
